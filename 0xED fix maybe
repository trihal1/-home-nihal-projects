rEFInd Bootloader Repair Guide (Ubuntu Live USB)
Step 1: Create and Boot the Live USB
 * On a working computer, download the Ubuntu ISO and use a tool like Rufus or balenaEtcher to create a bootable USB drive.
 * Insert the USB into your machine and reboot. Enter the BIOS/UEFI settings and set the USB drive as the first boot device.
 * When the Ubuntu boot menu appears, select "Try Ubuntu" to load the live environment.
Step 2: Access the Terminal and Identify Partitions
 * Once in the Ubuntu desktop, open the terminal.
 * Use the fdisk command to list all partitions on your drives.
   sudo fdisk -l

 * Identify your EFI System Partition (ESP). This is a small partition (100-500 MB) formatted as FAT32. Note its device name (e.g., /dev/sda1).
Step 3: Mount the EFI System Partition
 * Create a mount point.
   sudo mkdir /mnt/efi

 * Mount the EFI partition to the new mount point.
   sudo mount /dev/sdXN /mnt/efi

   Replace /dev/sdXN with your EFI partition's device name.
Step 4: Re-register and Configure rEFInd
 * Use efibootmgr to re-register the rEFInd bootloader with the system's firmware. This creates a new, valid boot entry.
   sudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -L "rEFInd Boot Manager" -l "\EFI\refind\refind_x64.efi"

   Replace /dev/sda and -p 1 with your specific drive and partition number.
 * View the current boot order.
   sudo efibootmgr

 * Set the new rEFInd boot entry as the primary boot option. Find the Boot number for your new rEFInd entry (e.g., Boot0005) and place it at the beginning of the list.
   sudo efibootmgr -o 0005,0001,0002,0003

   Replace the numbers with your own boot entry numbers.
Step 5: Unmount and Reboot
 * Unmount the EFI partition.
   sudo umount /mnt/efi

 * Shut down the computer, remove the USB drive, and boot from your main drive. The rEFInd boot manager should now appear and allow you to select your desired OS.
